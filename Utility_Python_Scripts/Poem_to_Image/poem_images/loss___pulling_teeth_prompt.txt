A diptych depicting the poem "Loss & Pulling Teeth."  The left panel is a **close-up, macro shot** of a healthy, strong tooth being extracted, rendered in a **surreal, painterly style** with visible brushstrokes.  The colors are **muted, yet vibrant**, focusing on deep reds representing blood and intense blues and greens for the tooth and gums.  The background is blurred, showcasing a **shallow depth of field** focusing solely on the tooth and the surrounding tissue.  The overall feeling is one of intense, physical pain. The right panel contrasts this with a **soft, pastel-toned, photorealistic** image. It shows a close-up of gums, smooth and healthy-pink, where a tooth once was.  A single, subtle highlight suggests the tongue gently touching the area. The background is a blurred, light-grey suggesting a hazy, dreamlike quality, representing the memory of loss.  The overall feeling is peaceful yet bittersweet. The lighting in both panels is **soft and diffused**, mimicking the passage of time and healing. The overall style is **expressive and emotionally charged**, capturing the duality of intense pain and peaceful acceptance in the poem.
