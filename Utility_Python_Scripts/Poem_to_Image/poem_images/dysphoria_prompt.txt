**A large-scale charcoal drawing, executed with a raw, expressive style, depicting a solitary figure prostrate in a desolate landscape.** The style evokes the emotional rawness and physicality of the poem, eschewing idealized beauty for a visceral representation of pain and despair.

The figure is depicted in a stark, almost skeletal manner, the body contorted and broken, suggesting both physical and emotional suffering.  The charcoal strokes are layered heavily, creating a deep, textured darkness that mirrors the poem’s oppressive atmosphere.  Areas are left deliberately smudged and undefined, reflecting the ambiguous nature of the dysphoria described.  The figure is not explicitly gendered, but its posture and vulnerability evoke a sense of profound helplessness.

The landscape itself is rendered in stark contrast.  The ground is a chaotic mix of dark, heavy charcoal strokes representing mud, punctuated by stark white areas signifying snow – this creates a visual dissonance echoing the internal conflict within the poem.   The sky is a vast, empty expanse of grey, with only faint suggestions of wind and swirling snow.  The coldness of the environment is emphasized through the use of sharp, almost scratchy charcoal strokes, mimicking the "frigid winds" and their piercing effect on the skin.

The composition utilizes strong diagonals and a low vantage point, emphasizing the figure’s vulnerability and the overwhelming nature of its suffering.  The lack of detail in the face enhances the sense of anonymity and the universality of the experience depicted. The emphasis is entirely on the physicality of the suffering, conveyed through sharp, textured contrasts and the raw emotional power of the charcoal.

The mood is one of intense, visceral despair, mirroring the poem's exploration of self-destruction and the allure of oblivion.  The piece does not offer solace or resolution; instead, it directly confronts the bleakness of the subject matter, forcing the viewer to confront the palpable weight of the figure's emotional torment. The raw, unsettling nature of the charcoal directly speaks to the "self-crucifixion" and the internal battle described in the poem's powerful imagery.
