--- CINEMATIC IMAGE PROMPT ---

1. **Shot type and composition:** A series of shots progressing from a tight close-up to a wide establishing shot, mirroring the emotional journey of the poem.  The initial shots will utilize shallow depth of field, focusing on specific details, while the final shots will encompass a broader landscape.

2. **Primary subject/scene:** The primary subject is the internal emotional landscape of the speaker, visualized through symbolic imagery.  The initial close-up focuses on a single, tear-stained eye, emphasizing the anguish and pain.  Subsequent shots show a figure walking away from a desolate, grey landscape, symbolic of the intentional disconnection from the past. The final wide shot shows the figure emerging into a vibrant green landscape, representing the pursuit of healing and renewal.  The lion’s jaw may be subtly represented in the background of a shot, perhaps as shadows or a distorted reflection, to remind the viewer of the hurt that has been endured.

3. **Lighting and atmosphere:** The film opens in a low-key, desaturated palette.  The lighting is stark and harsh, reflecting the initial anguish and pain.  As the scene progresses, the lighting gradually warms and brightens, shifting from cold greys and blues to vibrant greens and golden hues, mirroring the journey toward healing and recovery. A subtle halo effect might be applied to the figure in the final shot to emphasize hope and renewal.  The atmosphere is initially claustrophobic and oppressive, gradually opening up into a sense of freedom and liberation.

4. **Color palette and texture details:** The initial color palette is dominated by muted greys, blues, and browns, reflecting the emotional numbness and decay.  As the poem progresses, vibrant greens, yellows, and golds are introduced, symbolizing new growth and hope. Textures shift from rough, cracked surfaces (representing the broken heart) to smooth, flowing lines (representing healing and renewal). The skin of the figure shows a gradual progression of healing; initially pale and gaunt, it becomes healthier and more radiant over time.

5. **Environmental/atmospheric conditions:** The initial setting is a barren, desolate landscape— perhaps a rocky desert or a withered field—representing the emotional wasteland.  The final scene depicts a vibrant, lush meadow bathed in sunlight.  The change in environment is meant to evoke the speaker's emotional transformation.  The wind could be shown gently blowing through the grass in the final scene, as a visual metaphor for the emotional release and letting go.

6. **Artistic style references:** The visual style should draw inspiration from the works of Edward Hopper (for the initial scenes of isolation and melancholy) and Claude Monet (for the final scenes of vibrant nature and renewal).

7. **Technical photographic effects:**  The film should utilize a combination of shallow depth of field (emphasizing emotional focus), slow-motion sequences (highlighting emotional intensity), and color grading techniques (to emphasize the emotional shifts).  The use of film grain and deliberate blurring in the early shots might subtly suggest the fragmented nature of memories.  The final shot employs a slightly oversaturated and heightened colour palette to emphasize the restorative power of time and forgiveness.
