**A serene landscape painting executed in the style of a late Impressionist watercolor, depicting a figure resting in a sun-drenched meadow after a storm.** The style prioritizes soft, diffused light and the blending of colors to express the poem's sense of tranquil exhaustion and relief.

**The composition is a slightly elevated viewpoint, looking down upon the figure lying prostrate in a field of long, dew-laden grass.** The figure is small in the vastness of the landscape, emphasizing the feeling of overwhelming relief and the scale of the storm that has passed. The color palette is primarily composed of pale, washed-out blues and greens in the sky and grass, gradually warming into yellows and oranges in the foreground.

**The watercolor medium is crucial here.** The artist uses loose, flowing brushstrokes to create a sense of movement and ethereal lightness. The blue sky is depicted with feathery washes of color, subtly suggesting the lingering storm clouds. The grass is rendered with a mixture of soft, overlapping strokes, creating a sense of depth and texture while maintaining the overall softness.  The figure is merely suggested, sketched in pale tones, their form blending subtly into the landscape, emphasizing their physical and emotional exhaustion.  The artist will use a visible layering technique; we should see the underlying strokes of color bleeding and blending, mirroring the fading memory of the storm.

The lingering effects of the storm are subtly incorporated.  Faint, diluted streaks of grey and purple remain in the sky, while the still-wet grass shimmers with the reflected light, creating a glistening, dewy texture. These elements visualize the lines, "Storm clouds echo behind me," and "Thunder still whispers softly".  The vibrant yellows and oranges in the foreground represent the "sunlight" and the "warm, dewy grass", sharply contrasting with the lingering grey of the past storm.  The heavier, more saturated colors are concentrated around the resting figure, emphasizing their physical weight and emotional release.

**The mood is one of quiet, peaceful exhaustion, a sense of profound relief following intense struggle.** The soft, diffuse light and delicate washes of color create a sense of tranquility, while the subtle traces of the storm in the background add a touch of melancholy. This piece captures the profound feeling of completion and resting after great effort, perfectly encapsulating the poem's central theme of finding peace after weathering a difficult storm. The overall effect is one of gentle beauty and quiet contemplation, reflective of the exhausted but ultimately peaceful state of the poem's subject.
