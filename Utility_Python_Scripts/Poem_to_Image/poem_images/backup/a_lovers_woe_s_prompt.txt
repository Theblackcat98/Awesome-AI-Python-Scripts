--- ADVANCED POETRY IMAGE PROMPT (Artist Mode) ---

**A single, intensely detailed woodcut print, rendered in deep blacks and somber greys, depicting a desolate, symbolic landscape representing the emotional aftermath of a profound loss.** The style evokes traditional Japanese woodblock prints, but with a stark, modern interpretation.  The meticulous detail and stark contrast are key to conveying the poem's raw emotion and the overwhelming nature of grief.

The composition is a high-angle, almost bird's-eye view, focusing on a central, roughly hewn grave.  This grave is not a neat rectangle; it's an irregular shape, carved into the earth, implying a hurried, anguished burial.  Around this central grave, the land is depicted as a cracked and barren wasteland. The texture is created through varying degrees of ink density; the cracked earth is rendered with tight, broken lines, conveying a sense of fragility and disintegration, echoing the line "Decay runs rampant."

The color palette is stark and limited. Deep blacks dominate, suggesting the oppressive weight of grief.  However, subtle variations in shading and line weight introduce a sense of depth and texture.  A single, pale grey moon hangs high in the sky, representing the "acceptance the light as I work through the night."  Its faint light barely touches the scene, highlighting the utter desolation. There are no other light sources; the darkness is complete and absolute.


The poem's central metaphor of burial is directly visualized:  The grave is not simply a hole in the ground; it's a representation of the painful process of burying the past. The irregular lines suggest the chaotic and unpredictable nature of grief.  The barren landscape around the grave visually embodies the line, "Joy must be surrendered alongside its brother, good memories too intimately entwined"—the destruction of all positive elements within the speaker's life.  The woodcut's deliberate imperfections—the visible grain of the wood, the subtle inconsistencies in the inking—serve to amplify the feeling of loss and rawness.


The overall mood is one of profound sorrow, punctuated by a quiet, determined acceptance. The image is not sentimental or overly dramatic; it's a powerful visual representation of the brutal process of working through grief, its unforgiving nature, and the eventual, hard-won peace that follows.  The woodcut’s stark simplicity and evocative power perfectly encapsulate the poem's intense emotional core.
