A deeply intimate and tender depiction of a divine being, rendered in a **soft, painterly style** reminiscent of Botticelli or Fra Angelico.  The scene is a **close-up, slightly high-angle shot** focusing on the embrace between the divine figure (a dove-like being with soft, human-like hands and features, radiating a gentle golden light) and a human figure nestled protectively in its arms. The human figure's face is partially obscured, conveying a sense of peace and trust.

**Color palette:** Predominantly soft pastels with touches of gold, ivory, and deep blues (representing the "ocean of pain").  The dove's feathers are suggested by a delicate, almost ethereal texture. The background is softly blurred, hinting at lush gardens and a vast, peaceful sky.

**Lighting:** Soft, diffused light, emphasizing the intimacy of the embrace and the divine figure's gentle radiance.  A subtle golden glow emanates from the dove-like being, contrasting with the darker blues of the background, symbolizing the transition from pain to peace.

The overall atmosphere should convey profound love, comfort, and spiritual protection. The image should evoke feelings of safety, security, and transcendent intimacy. The texture of the dove's wings and the human figure's hair and clothing should be subtly suggested, avoiding harsh outlines. The focus should be on the emotional connection between the figures, emphasizing the themes of shelter, protection, and unwavering love. The style should evoke the feeling of a sacred icon or a deeply personal, spiritual vision.
