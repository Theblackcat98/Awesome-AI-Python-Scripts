--- CINEMATIC IMAGE PROMPT ---

A painterly, wide shot depicting a colossal redwood, fractured and fallen amidst a misty coastal forest, rendered in a desaturated, melancholic palette of greens, browns, and muted reds.  The fallen giant dominates the foreground, its splintered, steel-grey bark contrasting with the soft, verdant moss clinging to its decaying form.  The background features a shallow depth of field, blurring the towering, sun-dappled survivors into an ethereal haze.  Low, diffused light filters through the fog, casting long, somber shadows that emphasize the redwood's monumental scale and tragic fate.  The overall mood is one of quiet acceptance and profound loss, achieved through a blend of painterly texture and photographic realism, reminiscent of Caspar David Friedrichâ€™s dramatic landscapes, with a subtle film grain adding to the timeless quality of the scene.  The cool, damp air and the soft texture of the moss convey a sense of melancholy tranquility.
