A solitary figure sits on a wooden park bench beneath lush green trees, a gentle breeze rustling the leaves.  The figure wears sunglasses, obscuring their teary eyes, and holds a cup of coffee.  The scene is bathed in soft, dappled sunlight.  The overall mood is melancholic and introspective. The background subtly suggests a busy city street, with blurred figures representing passersby.  The colors are muted greens, browns, and soft blues, with a hint of warm sunlight.  The figure's posture conveys weariness and despair.  The coffee cup symbolizes a momentary comfort in a sea of emptiness. In the background, hints of deep blue water and a stormy grey sky are visible, symbolizing the emotional turmoil of the poem's speaker. The image should evoke a sense of loneliness and longing, with a subtle suggestion of hope and eventual rescue.  A faint, ethereal glow may surround the figure, representing the watchful presence of the poem's implied "you." The style should be realistic but with a slightly surreal undertone.  The overall feel should be one of poignant sadness and fragile hope.
