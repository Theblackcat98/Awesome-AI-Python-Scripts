A stylized digital painting depicting a dramatic landscape of towering mountains and deep valleys, rendered in a vibrant yet slightly desaturated color palette.  The style should evoke a sense of both awe and vulnerability.  The mountains are jagged and imposing, with stormy, dark clouds swirling around their peaks.  Deep, shadowy valleys contrast sharply with the bright, almost ethereal light emanating from a central figure, suggested only by an outpouring of warm, golden light in a valley. The light suggests the presence of a comforting and powerful force.  The overall effect should be one of fierce, untamed nature contrasted with a powerful, hopeful inner light.   Use a high contrast between light and shadow, emphasizing the dramatic interplay between the tumultuous landscape and the serene, emanating light. The lighting should be a mix of dramatic chiaroscuro and soft, celestial glow.  Texture should be rough and textured for the mountains and valleys, and smooth, almost luminous for the light.  The image should be a wide shot, capturing the vastness of the landscape, with the central point of light in the lower third.  The mood is one of both struggle and ultimate peace, hinting at a spiritual journey.  The artistic style should be similar to that of a fantasy illustration,  with elements of realism in the texture and scale of the landscape.  Focus should be relatively even across the scene, so that both the grand scale and the radiant light are visible and impactful.
