--- CINEMATIC IMAGE PROMPT ---

A painterly, wide shot depicting a desolate, moonlit landscape in a muted, desaturated palette of grays, blues, and deep purples.  The style evokes a melancholic, post-impressionistic mood reminiscent of Edvard Munch.  A lone figure, shrouded in shadow and rendered with blurry, indistinct features, kneels amidst a field of decaying, thorny vines, the ground textured with cracked earth and loose, dark soil.  The lighting is low-key and dramatic, with a single, pale moon casting elongated shadows that stretch across the scene.  A shallow depth of field keeps the figure in sharp focus while the background fades into an ethereal, dreamlike haze.  The overall effect is one of profound grief and loss, the atmospheric conditions mirroring the internal turmoil of the subject, visually representing the poem's themes of decay and the violent struggle with mourning.  A subtle film grain adds a vintage, slightly melancholic quality, enhancing the emotional weight of the scene.
