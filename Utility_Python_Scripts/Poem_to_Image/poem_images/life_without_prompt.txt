--- CINEMATIC IMAGE PROMPT ---

A painterly, close-up shot depicting a heart rendered in somber, desaturated hues of grey and muted blues, reminiscent of a post-surgical scene in a dark, almost monochromatic style. The heart, the primary subject, is subtly textured, appearing both fragile and resilient, like aged parchment.  The background is a blurred, out-of-focus landscape of muted greens and browns, suggesting distant “greener pastures,” while shallow depth of field draws focus to the central, wounded heart.  A single, stark white light source illuminates the heart, casting a dramatic chiaroscuro effect that highlights its wounds and the subtle lines of healing.  The overall mood is one of melancholic resolution, yet hopeful.  Inspired by the somber palette of Edward Hopper, this image evokes a sense of quiet strength and the eventual triumph of self-preservation, with a subtle film grain adding a touch of nostalgic texture.  The overall visual language aims to capture the poem's themes of loss, healing, and forgiveness through a symbolic representation of the heart's journey toward recovery.
