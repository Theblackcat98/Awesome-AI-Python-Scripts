A stylized, painterly portrait depicting a solitary figure, possibly androgynous, with their face partially obscured by shadow and long hair.  The style should evoke a sense of emotional depth and vulnerability, perhaps reminiscent of Edvard Munch or Egon Schiele.  The color palette is muted, with deep blues, purples, and grays dominating, punctuated by occasional flickers of warmer tones representing a faint, persistent hope.  The background is subtly textured, suggestive of a crumbling, old stone wall, reflecting the poem's themes of damaged emotional walls.  The figure's posture is slightly hunched, conveying a sense of weariness and longing.  The eyes, if visible, should hint at both despair and a quiet, persistent yearning. The overall mood is melancholic, yet imbued with a strange resilience.  The image should be a close-up, focusing on the figure's emotional state, with a slightly blurred background to emphasize the figure's isolation and inward focus.  The brushstrokes should be visible, adding to the textured emotional atmosphere of the piece.  The lighting is soft, diffused light, not harsh, allowing for shadows to play a significant role in conveying the inner turmoil.
