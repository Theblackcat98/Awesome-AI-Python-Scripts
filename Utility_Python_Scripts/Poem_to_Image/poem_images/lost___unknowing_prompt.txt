A close-up, painterly portrait of a person with bloodshot eyes, reflecting deep sorrow and exhaustion. The style is reminiscent of Edvard Munch's expressive work, using a palette of dark, muted blues, grays, and deep reds, highlighting the bloodshot eyes. The lighting is dim and diffused, casting soft shadows on the face, emphasizing the hollow cheeks and the overall sense of debilitation. Visible brushstrokes add to the emotional intensity. The background is a blurry, dark abyss, suggesting the overwhelming depression.  The overall mood is one of intense emotional pain, isolation, and despair.  Shallow depth of field focuses sharply on the eyes and face, blurring the background into an indistinct void.  The texture of the skin is visible, showing signs of weariness and suffering.
