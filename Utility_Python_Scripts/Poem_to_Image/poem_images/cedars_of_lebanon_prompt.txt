--- CINEMATIC IMAGE PROMPT ---

1. **Shot type and composition:**  A medium close-up shot, focusing on the intertwined branches of ancient cedar trees, framing a figure partially obscured within their embrace.  The composition uses leading lines of the branches to guide the eye towards the central figure.

2. **Primary subject/scene:**  A solitary figure, gender-neutral and androgynous, rests nestled amongst the thick, ancient boughs of towering cedar trees. The figure appears peaceful and serene, conveying a sense of profound solace and acceptance. The cedar trees themselves are majestic and ancient, symbolic of enduring strength, stability, and spiritual connection.

3. **Lighting and atmosphere:**  Soft, diffused light filters through the dense canopy, creating a dappled effect on the figure and surrounding foliage. The overall atmosphere is one of tranquility and quiet intimacy; a golden hour lighting suggests warmth and a sense of timeless peace. A slight ethereal glow emanates from the figure, hinting at a spiritual connection with the trees.

4. **Color palette and texture details:**  A rich, earthy color palette predominates: deep greens of the cedar needles, warm browns of the bark, and soft, muted golds in the filtered light.  Textures are crucial; the rough, ancient bark of the cedars contrasts with the soft, almost ethereal quality of the figure's clothing (if visible) and skin. The overall texture should be both rugged and comforting.

5. **Environmental/atmospheric conditions:**  A gentle breeze rustles the cedar branches, creating a subtle movement and sound. The air feels still and peaceful, hinting at a secluded, almost sacred grove.  A faint mist or fog adds to the mystical atmosphere.

6. **Artistic style references:**  The overall aesthetic should evoke Caspar David Friedrich's Romantic landscapes, emphasizing the sublime and the connection between humanity and nature.  The lighting and composition should also draw inspiration from cinematic works known for their evocative use of natural settings and emotional depth.

7. **Technical photographic effects:**  Shallow depth of field to blur the background and emphasize the figure within the trees.  A subtle lens flare can enhance the ethereal quality of the light.  Film grain adds a timeless and classic feel, reinforcing the sense of enduring love and connection.  The use of a slightly desaturated color palette enhances the dreamlike quality of the scene.
