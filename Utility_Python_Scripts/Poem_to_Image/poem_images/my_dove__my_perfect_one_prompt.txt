--- CINEMATIC IMAGE PROMPT ---

A painterly, close-up portrait rendered in the style of a Pre-Raphaelite painting, depicting a serene woman nestled within the protective embrace of a shadowy, dove-like figure. The color palette is a soft, muted blend of deep blues, earthy browns, and ethereal whites, illuminated by a gentle, diffused light suggesting dawn or dusk.  The woman's face is partially obscured, her expression one of tranquil peace, bathed in a warm, golden glow emanating from the dove-like figure.  The texture is rich and tactile, with soft fabrics and feathers subtly suggested.  A shallow depth of field emphasizes the intimacy of the scene, blurring the background into a hazy, dreamlike landscape of rolling hills and a distant ocean, symbolizing the pain left behind.  The overall mood is one of profound comfort, solace, and unwavering devotion, imbued with a sense of sacred intimacy and divine protection.  A subtle film grain adds a nostalgic, timeless quality to the image.
