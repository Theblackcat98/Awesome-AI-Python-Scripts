A **digital art painting**, in the style of a melancholic, impressionistic portrait, depicting a person submerged in a sea of dark, swirling blues and grays, representing "waves of sadness."  The figure is partially obscured, their face downcast, with only hints of features visible, expressing profound sorrow.  The overall lighting is subdued, with muted colors reflecting the "days muted by sobbing."  A faint, almost ethereal, light source suggests a glimmer of hope, possibly emanating from a distant, blurred figure representing loved ones or a higher power. The texture should be slightly rough, almost as if painted with thick brushstrokes, to convey a feeling of emotional turmoil. **Shallow depth of field**, focusing sharply on the figure's face while the surrounding sea of sadness blurs softly.  The color palette consists primarily of deep blues, somber grays, and muted purples, with a touch of pale yellow or white suggesting a fragile hope. The overall mood should be one of profound sadness, but with a subtle undercurrent of resilience and perseverance. The image should emphasize the feeling of being "on the edge," with a sense of precariousness and vulnerability.
