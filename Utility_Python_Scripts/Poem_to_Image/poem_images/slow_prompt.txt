A stylized, painterly image depicting a heart, initially shown as hardened and scarred, like coarse, knotted wool, gradually softening and blooming into a delicate flower with pale petals.  The background should subtly suggest a celestial scene, with hints of stars and constellations, representing the "heavens" mentioned in the poem. The overall color palette should be muted, transitioning from dark, earthy tones (representing the hardened heart and pain) to softer pastels (representing healing and blooming). The image should convey a sense of gentle hope and the passage of time, with the flower's growth symbolizing healing and trust.  Include elements of hands gently tending to the flower/heart, suggesting nurturing and support.  The overall mood should be one of melancholic hope and patient acceptance.
