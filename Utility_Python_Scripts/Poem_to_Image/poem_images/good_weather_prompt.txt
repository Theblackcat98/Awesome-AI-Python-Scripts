--- CINEMATIC IMAGE PROMPT ---

A painterly, wide shot depicting a lone figure lying prostrate in a sun-drenched field of dew-kissed grass, rendered in a palette of warm golds, soft blues, and muted greens reminiscent of a Pre-Raphaelite landscape.  The figure, small in scale against the expansive sky, is bathed in the hazy, golden light of a late afternoon sun, creating a shallow depth of field that blurs the background into an impressionistic wash of color.  Dark, storm clouds linger on the horizon, their edges softened and diffused, hinting at past turmoil.  The overall texture is soft and ethereal, with a subtle film grain effect to enhance the nostalgic mood.  The atmosphere is one of tranquil peace, a gentle breeze rustling through the grass, creating a sense of quietude and release, like the aftermath of a fierce internal struggle.  The scene evokes a feeling of profound rest and acceptance, as if the weight of the world has been lifted.
